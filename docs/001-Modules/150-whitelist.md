  ◉ Only enable this module in offline server.
  
  If you are hosting an online-mode server, then you didn't need to enable this module.
  
  
  
  ◉ What is the difference?
  
  For `online-mode` server, the `UUID` of a player is determined, and always identical.
  
  For `offline-mode` server, the `UUID` of a player is changed by the `authenticate method` of the player, and affected by the `user cache` in server side.
