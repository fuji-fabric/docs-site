  â—‰ How it works?
  
  
  
  If a player `right click` a `sign block`.
  
  We will check if the `facing texts` contains the `/` character.
  
  If contains, we will treat as the player issue the command.


:::

:::colorbox-tip

  A `sign block` that contains the `character /` is called an `interactive sign block`.
  
  You can use `right click` to execute the commands written on the interactive sign block.
  
  You can use `shift + right click` to edit an `interactive sign block`.


:::

:::colorbox-tip

  You can write some comment text before the first `character /`.
  
  All 4 lines will be joined and treated as one single big line.
  
  So be careful with the `space character`, and ignore the `linefeed character`.
