# Module: command_alias

## Overview
:::module
  This module allows you to define alias for existing commands.
  
  The defined alies command will redirect to the existing command node.

## Color Boxes

:::colorbox-tip

  The `command_alias` command only has the ability to define `a new command`, as the alias of `an existing command`.
  
  It works by `command redirecting`.
  
  You can't use `command_alias` module to actually define `a new command with arguments`, that's the weakness.
  
  If you want to define `a new command with arguments`, see `command_bundle` module.
  
  
  
  In short:
  
  1. To define `a simple command` with no arguments, use `command_alias` module.
  
  2. To define `a complex command` with arguments, use `command_bundle` module.

:::colorbox-example

  â—‰ Define a `new shortcut command` as an alias to `an existing command`.
  
  For example:
  
  1. Define a new `/r` command, as alias to `/reply` command.
  
  2. Define a new `/sudo` command, as alias to `/run as fake-op` command.
