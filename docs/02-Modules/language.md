  ◉ What is client-side language?
  
  After `Minecraft 1.20.1`, the `client` will send its `client side language option` to the `server`.
  
  So the `server` can respect the `client-side language` if possible.
  
  
  
  ◉ What is the difference?
  
  When disable this module: fuji will always use `default_language` for all players.
  
  When enable this module: fuji will try to respect the player's `client-side language option` if possible.
  
  
  
  That's to say, if you enable this module, then fuji will support `multiple language` at the same time.
  
  Fuji will use `different languages` for different players. (Respect the client-side language option)
