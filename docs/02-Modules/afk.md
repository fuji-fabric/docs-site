# Module: afk

## Overview
:::module
This module provides:
1. Afk detection: If a player idle too long, we will mark it as afk state.
2. Afk event: Execute commands when a player enters or leaves afk state.
3. Afk name customization: For a afk player, we can customize its display name in tab list.

â—‰ How it works?



For each player, define a `number` to track `the last action time`.

Actions can be: `mine a block`, `movement`, `issue a command` ...

When action received, update the number.

Define a `job` using cron, to be triggered periodically.

The job will check and compare 2 consecutive value of the `number`.

If number is identical, then the player is considered as in `afk`.
